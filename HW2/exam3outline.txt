# HEAPS
- Know about the two heap properties: Max-heap vs. min-heap
- Know all the heap operations and how they work
- Know how heaps are stored in arrays and how to calculate the parent index from the child's index, and vice versa
- Heap-Sort!

# HASH TABLES
- Understand hash functions, what they're for and what makes a good one
- Collisions -- what they are, and strategies for dealing with them
       linear probing, "quadratic" probing, etc... chaining
- Various operations on hash tables... what they're good at and under what conditions.

# GRAPHS
- Understand the different graph representations and tradeoffs
    adjacency list, adjacency matrix
- Know the terms directed graph, weighted graph, DAG (directed acyclic graph)
- Djikstra's algorithm; what it does and how it works (we spent a lot of time on this!!)
- Understand and be able to write graph traversal pseudo-code (Depth first vs. breadth first search)
- Minimum Spanning Trees - Kruskal (mostly) and Prim (high level understanding)... differences, similarities, etc.

AVL Trees

Not the details... but definitely know what they're for, roughly how they work, what the basis for balancing is, what a balancing factor is and how it is used, etc.
