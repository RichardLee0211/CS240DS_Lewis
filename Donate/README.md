If you have finished CA 1, please attend anyway and help your fellow classmates, or work on a "CA1 Bonus Assignment".

For the Bonus, you can earn 5 extra points (do it for the challenge, notfor the points!), for "bullet-proofing" your code, and making it more user friendly.

For bullet-proofing, make it so that users must enter well-formed input, otherwise your program will recognize that it is NOT proper input, and do something intelligent.  (For example, you should reject the input, indicate what the problem is with the input, and re-prompt the user.)

To make it more user-friendly, allow users to save typing time by changing the way "Manage" works. Your Bonus implementation should show each current value (for Last name, first name, etc.), one at a time, with the prompt, and should allow the user to simply hit <Enter> to keep that value the way it is.  With the standard implementation, users need to retype everything when they select the "Manage" option.
